        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Define the high level requirements of the enterprise (this step generates a document known as the system requirements specification.)</li>
            <li> Define a model containing all appropriate types of data and data relationships</li>
            <li> Define the integrity constraints on the data </li>
            <li> Define the physical level</li>
            <li> For each known problem to be solved on a regular basis (e.g., tasks to be carried out by clerks or Web users) define a user interface to carry out the task, and write the necessary application programs to implement the user interface</li>
            <li> Create/initialize the database</li>
